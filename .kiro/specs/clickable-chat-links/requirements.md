# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to interact with URLs, links, and document files that appear in chat messages by making them clickable and openable. When users tap on a link in a chat message, it should open in their default browser or appropriate application, providing a seamless way to access shared web content and documents without having to manually copy and paste URLs or file paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chat viewer, I want to tap on URLs in chat messages, so that I can quickly access shared web content without manually copying links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message contains a valid URL THEN the system SHALL detect and highlight the URL with blue color and underline styling
2. WHEN a user taps on a highlighted URL THEN the system SHALL open the link in the device's default external browser
3. WHEN a URL starts with "http://" or "https://" THEN the system SHALL launch it directly
4. WHEN a URL starts with "www." without protocol THEN the system SHALL prepend "https://" before launching
5. WHEN the system cannot launch a URL THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without crashing the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chat viewer, I want URLs to be visually distinguishable from regular text, so that I can easily identify clickable links in messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message contains URLs THEN the system SHALL display URLs in blue color
2. WHEN a message contains URLs THEN the system SHALL underline the URL text
3. WHEN a message contains both URLs and regular text THEN the system SHALL maintain proper text formatting for non-URL content
4. WHEN multiple URLs exist in a single message THEN the system SHALL make each URL individually clickable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chat viewer, I want the URL detection to work with various common URL formats, so that different types of shared links are properly recognized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message contains URLs with "https://" protocol THEN the system SHALL detect and make them clickable
2. WHEN a message contains URLs with "http://" protocol THEN the system SHALL detect and make them clickable  
3. WHEN a message contains URLs starting with "www." THEN the system SHALL detect and make them clickable
4. WHEN a message contains domain-only URLs (e.g., "example.com") THEN the system SHALL detect and make them clickable
5. WHEN a message contains URLs with paths, parameters, or fragments THEN the system SHALL detect the complete URL and make it clickable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chat viewer, I want to open PDF files and documents shared in chat, so that I can view document content without leaving the chat interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message contains a PDF file path or URL ending with ".pdf" THEN the system SHALL detect and make it clickable
2. WHEN a user taps on a PDF link THEN the system SHALL open the PDF in the default PDF viewer application
3. WHEN a message contains document file paths ending with ".doc", ".docx", ".txt", or ".rtf" THEN the system SHALL detect and make them clickable
4. WHEN a user taps on a document link THEN the system SHALL open the document in the appropriate default application
5. WHEN the system cannot open a document file THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chat viewer, I want file links to be visually distinguishable from web URLs, so that I can identify the type of content before clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message contains PDF links THEN the system SHALL display them with a distinct visual indicator (e.g., PDF icon or different color)
2. WHEN a message contains document links THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate file type indicators
3. WHEN a message contains both web URLs and file links THEN the system SHALL visually differentiate between them
4. WHEN hovering over or long-pressing a link THEN the system SHALL show a preview or tooltip indicating the link type
